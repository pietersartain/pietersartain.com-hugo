This is my blog, now loosely based off the lovely looking [Hemingway2](http://themes.gohugo.io/hemingway2/) Hugo template.

Unlike my previous effort with Jekyll, I've managed to keep this template intact, only hacking in a few template and CSS overrides for my own style.

## Learning and next steps

Having used an already functional template and gotten it to work, it's probably time to stop thinking about the code and start thinking about the content. The last redesign effort totally failed to launch, so I should probably stop that.

I do find the theme HTML templates and sass not quite to my taste, and certainly not mobile responsive, however the override system in Hugo has let me work around the problem quite handily.

The next steps here are:

 * Use it to post things. The quality of the code is worthless if there's no readable content on it.
 * When I'm bored of hoop jumping to get the content published, automate the pipeline. Werker et al provide some good options, but maybe this is a reasonable starting case for [platformr](https://github.com/pietersartain/platformr)?
 * Mobile responsive. This will probably mean disassembling the template and building it back up, because I have yet to construct a sensible strategy for retrofitting mobile & responsive into a non-responsive site.
 * HTTPS everywhere. I'm uncertain how to do this without access to a web server, but I'm positive it's more possible now than it ever has been in the past.
 * Pygments code highlighting
