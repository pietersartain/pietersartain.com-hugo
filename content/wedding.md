<p>There is parking at Edes House, which we will reserve for you, which will be yours all day Saturday until Monday morning. The house address is: 27 West St, Chichester PO19 1RW.</p>

<p>There's going to be a Christmas market on in Chichester that day as well, in case anyone is there early and needs occupying.</p>

<p>The food and drink menu is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hT4B20dtzf19ggB4gURMF5GyzJa6V2jnVykDi6YOTbE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> if you'd like to see what's on offer. The cheesecakes will be a surprise, but we have plenty of choices for everyone (including vegetarian!).</p>

<h1>Dressing up and down</h1>

<p>Pam has a lovely new 50s-style dress, and Piete is planning on making some more use of his fanciest suit, but we don't mind what you wear so long as you're comfortable.</p>

<p>Dress up (or down!) as much as you want (we understand muslin is in this season), but we are both going to have a bit of <span style="color:red">red</span> in our outfits to get into the Christmas spirit, and we'd be more than happy if you'd like to join us!</p>

<h1>Presence not presents</h1>

<p>We have invited you for your presence, not your presents. You've taken the time out to come and see us, and we want to make sure you enjoy yourselves. Everything is free and open, you only need to turn up!</p>

<p>There is no gift list, because genuinely we feel we have got enough stuff already! If you feel you haven't spent enough, please put the money toward a donation to a charity of your choice (or <a href="http://www.gosh.org/">Great Ormond's Street Hospital Charity</a> if you have no preference).</p>

<h1>Lots of tiny people</h1>

<p>Turns out that a lot of our friends &amp; family have children of one age or another, so bring them with you! Just make sure you take the correct child home afterwards ...</p>

<p>Don't want to bring your child? That's fine too. Do whatever you're most comfortable with.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="slide" data-background="rgb(219, 169, 76)">
<div class="content">
<h1>Making memories</h1>

<p>Lots of tiny humans also gives us an excuse to indulge in another of our favourite things: board games! We've got some old classics and some newer pieces, but nothing too complicated or X-rated.</p>

<p>We hope everyone can find something to enjoy, but if gaming isn't your thing, that's fine too! Enjoy the open bar and relax to whatever Piete's put on the music playlist.</p>

<p>Oh, and there's going to be a <a href="http://adorlee.co.uk">photographer</a> there to catch everything, so we'll be on the lookout for photos of each and every one of you!</p>

<h1>Staying over</h1>

The closest place to Edes House is <a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/496/Chichester-Central-hotel?rooms%5B0%5D%5BroomId%5D=eecevx3g8w5ono&rooms%5B0%5D%5Badults%5D=1&rooms%5B0%5D%5Bchildren%5D=0&rooms%5B0%5D%5Bextras%5D%5B0%5D=&strikeThroughShown=0">a Travelodge within 3 minutes walk</a>. We're obviously heading home after the event, but we're happy to investigate alternative options for you (we'll be checking <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/">TripAdvisor</a>!) if you let us know.

<h1>The day after</h1>

We really have no plans for the day after except sleeping in, so if you've already made the trip and want to stop by and see us, please do! Our home will be open from 11am on Sunday 3rd December, and you're all invited to come visit. We'll have some more food (quorn chilli and bits) and possibly some spare cheesecake!
