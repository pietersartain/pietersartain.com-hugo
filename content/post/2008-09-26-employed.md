What started with a few stressful phone calls at the start of August has lead inexorably toward being employed in the same location, by the same people, doing a different job!

There are pros and cons about this choice, and my biggest worry has been that I would upset someone along the way. I hope if I run into them again in 12 months time they won't hold this decision against me.

In guild news, taking this job gives me a stack of free time to work on [Peace and Quiet](https://github.com/pietersartain/dokuwiki-plugin-pqraid) and start to put together the technical aspects.

More to come!

Edit: My current employer has a spin-out company that is getting venture capital funding. My wage is drawn from that funding, with the intent of adding value to that company. So when I say same location, same people, different job; it's a very different role with very different motivations and problems.
