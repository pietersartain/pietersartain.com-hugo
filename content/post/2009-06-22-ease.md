Catching up on some RSS subscriptions this morning, I found myself reading [Kent Beck's blog](http://www.threeriverinstitute.org/blog/) about the Open/Closed Principle. Flipping back through his past posts, the talk [Ease at Work](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?p=205) really grabbed me. I recommend you watch it.

I especially like the comparison between joy and fun at about 24 minutes in (4min into the 3rd part).

The idea of being at ease with yourself put me in mind of MacGyver, and how he's always very content to be what he is, doing what he's doing.

When I grow up, I'd like to be MacGyver.
