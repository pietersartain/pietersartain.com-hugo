This is what it's all been leading up to. I have a good shot at it providing I don't screw up the C test and subsequently stick my foot in my mouth. 1pm Wednesday 3rd June.

But that's not why I'm writing today. No no. Today, I am writing because this is a post that I lost after Firefox crashed and because it's related to interviews.

Speaking to a friend recently (TLW is getting quite a cast, I wonder if I should start including a cast list?) he was incredulous that I felt under qualified for everything. This exchange put me in mind of another friend who put up with a rather long afternoon of whining from me over job applications. She said two things which will stick with me, probably indefinitely: "If you're this sad filing the forms out, do you really want to work there?" and in response to rather self-centered moan on how I'm sure things will look up if I can just get an interview: "But until then, you have friends to help prop you up."

Firstly, they're both paraphrased, so my apologies if I've misquoted. The mistake is entirely mine. Secondly, she was right. If the forms fill you with dread or the notion of that place just doesn't sit right even before you've been to interview, why bother?

So to all my friends who have put up with insufferable me for the past few months, thank you. I could not have made it this far without you.

And to the quoted: maybe you should take some of your own advice? Lean on friends and find something you really want to do.
