= Working with this repo

This repo contains source materials to accompany the article on opensource.com for getting started with Hugo and asciidoc as a web development platform.

== Installing Asciidoc and Asciidoctor.
.Ubuntu
Asciidoc is available in the default repos.
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install asciidoc asciidoctor -y
----

.Fedora
Asciidoctor can be installed using the gem command. Asciidoc is installed through the standard repos.
[source,bash]
----
yum install asciidoc
gem install asciidoctor
----

For more detailed installation information, visit the following guides.

.Installation Guides
* http://asciidoc.org/INSTALL.html[Asciidoc].
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/[Asciidoctor].

== Installing Hugo
The best guide for https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/[installing Hugo] is on their website. I found it was worth following this guide rather than use the package maintained in the Ubuntu repo as it was older and caused problems with modern themes.

== How do I use these files?
The repo contains a demo website with some sample articles in Asciidoc. The following folders are useful starting points.

.Clone the repo
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:opensourceway/asciidoc-blog.git
----

For more information, checkout the documentation on the https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/[Hugo Homepage]

.Starting the server
From the root directory of the cloned repo:
[source,bash]
----
hugo server  --buildDrafts
----

This will run the server where you can see your website locally on http://localhost:1313[http://localhost:1313].

To make changes to the setup, you can edit the config.toml file and set your website preferences up. The site contains initial setup parameters.

Content is available under the folder content/post. There are some example articles available to get you started.

== Working with Asciidoc
My personal preference is to use http://www.vim.org/download.php[Vim] for working with http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc],
there are a number of plugins which make working with Asciidoc easier as well as a http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1832[syntax file] for highlighting your document.

If you are looking for something more visual, I would recommend the https://atom.io/[Atom editor] from GitHub.
It has plugins which provide a real-time preview of your work and makes it easier to work with GitHub.
Using Hugo, Asciidoc and the Atom editor, gives you a complete publishing system with real time previews and a local server to run validation against.

== Thanks and credit due.
Thanks to http://spf13.com[Steve Francia]	for https://gohugo.io/[Hugo], for producing an amazing platform and fun to play with.
The https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-strata-theme[Strata theme] port and the https://discourse.gohugo.io/[Hugo community].

== Where to go from here?
You can tailor the site in the config.toml file to personalise your setup. There are a number of https://themes.gohugo.io/[themes] available to further customise your site.
The language behind the more dynamic elements is very well implemented and there's excellent documentation on the Hugo website on how to get started working with https://gohugo.io/templates/[content and theming]. The theme used in this demo is the https://themes.gohugo.io/strata/[Strata Theme] by https://github.com/digitalcraftsman[Digitalcraftsman] which has detailed documentation on configuration options available on it's https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-strata-theme[github page].
