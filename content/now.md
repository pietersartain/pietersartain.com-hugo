Since starting my software consultancy [Hyperrational](https://www.hyperrational.tech) in April 2021, I've been on a wild ride of self-employment and self-discovery.

I have painted some cats, written a lot of react-three-fiber code and submitted my personal details endless numbers of times to financial institutions.

[Hyperrational](https://www.hyperrational.tech) built a 3D organiser originally named Envoy, which has been spun out into [Orynt3D](https://www.orynt3d.com). Meanwhile a friend we made on the Hyperrational journal asked us if we wanted to take up the mantle of [Minihoarder](https://www.minihoarder.com) and [Wargaming3D](https://www.wargaming3d.com), which we have done, and thus [Playable Prints](https://www.playableprints.co.uk) was born to hold all of the various 3D printing bits we've accomplished.

At home I'm finally fixing the bathrooms.

My todo list has gotten big, which is a sign that I may not be handling life as much as I'm handling work.
