[Playable Prints](https://www.playableprints.co.uk) has been successfully running for over a year now as the umbrella organisation housing [Minihoarder](https://www.minihoarder.com), [Wargaming3D](https://www.wargaming3d.com) and [Orynt3D](https://www.orynt3d.com).

The software consultancy [Hyperrational](https://www.hyperrational.tech) is winding down, to focus on Playable Prints.

At home I've fixed one bathroom, and removed the walls from another. I've had a skip on the driveway for too long, so that clearly needs correcting this year.

Since June 2023 I've been playing music out again, performing locally in Southsea. In December 2023 I did my first ever solo show! I'm excited to write more and do that some more over 2024.
